The goal of this application is to offer a simple medium to 'journal' their thoughts daily in the form of audio files.</br>
Users can record and store audio entries. They can acess and playback their files using a built-in calander. </br>
Straightfoward, minimalist UI with good audio recording and playback quality and seamless access makes this app 
perfect for those looking to begin journaling but would rather sit back and vocalize their thoughts. </br>
Designed using Qt Creator and C++. </br>
